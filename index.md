###Geography
The weather is a little cold here, but you'll be able to grow just enough to support your family and take
on whatever other challenge you'd like to. Want to hunt beaver for pelts to sell? They love it up here in the cold,
and that's good for you. Want to go boating, or build your own ship? Excellent! New England has long coastlines
perfectly suited for just that purpose. Want to go fishing instead? The waters around New England are heavily populated
with delicious fish for you to sell or eat yourself!
